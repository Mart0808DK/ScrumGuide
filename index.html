            <h2>Why SCRUM as a CS student?</h2>
            <i>“SCRUM is a way to work together as a team to create cool things! It's like a game plan for how to get things done. SCRUM breaks everything into small pieces and gives us a clear plan for what needs to be done and who's responsible for each piece. This helps us work faster, smarter, and more efficiently. Plus, it's a lot of fun!”</i>
