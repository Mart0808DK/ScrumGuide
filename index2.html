            <h2>SCRUM theory</h2>
            <i>“In Scrum theory were working with three core values:</i>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Transparency: </b> refers to the concept of having a shared understanding of what is happening on a project. This means that everyone involved has access to the same information and can see the progress being made</li>
                <li><b>Inspection: </b> involves regularly reviewing the progress made on a project and comparing it to the original plan. This allows the team to identify any deviations from the plan and take corrective action as needed</li>
                <li><b>Adaptation: </b> refers to the idea that the team should be willing to adjust the plan as needed to ensure that the project is successful. This means that the team needs to be flexible and willing to make changes when necessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SCRUM teams</h2>
            <i>In the SCRUM framework, there are three main roles:</i>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Product Owner</b></li>
                <li><b>Development Team</b></li>
                <li><b>Scrum Master</b></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><b>The Product Owner</b> is responsible for representing the needs and desires of the stakeholders and ensuring that the team is working on the most important tasks. They prioritise the Product Backlog and ensure that it is up-to-date.</p>
            <p><b>The Development Team</b> is responsible for creating the product. They work together to complete tasks and deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each Sprint</p>
            <p><b>The Scrum Master</b> is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed correctly. They facilitate the Scrum events, remove any impediments that the team may face, and help the team continuously improve their process.
            These roles work together to ensure that the team is delivering high-quality products that meet customer needs, increasing productivity and efficiency, managing and reducing project risk, promoting teamwork and collaboration, improving communication and transparency, and adapting to changing requirements and priorities.
            Scrum has a flat hierarchical structure. This means that the team is self-organising, highly autonomous, cross-functional and communal. The team shares in the decision-making and organising around a project and are responsible for the outcome

        <section id="scrum-events">
            <h2>SCRUM event</h2>
            <i>Scrum events are time-boxed meetings or ceremonies that provide opportunities for the Scrum Team to synchronize, collaborate, and plan the work. They include</i>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sprint: </b> A Scrum sprint is a time-boxed iteration of work during which the team works to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. Task estimation is an important part of sprint planning, and the use of empirical data helps the team plan future sprints based on their past performance.</li>
                <li><b>Sprint Planning</b> A meeting where the Development Team and Product Owner collaborate to plan the work to be completed in the upcoming Sprint.</li>
                <li><b>Daily Scrum: </b> A 15-minute daily meeting where the Development Team synchronizes their work and identifies any impediments or risks.</æ>
                <li><b>Sprint Review: </b> A meeting at the end of the Sprint where the Development Team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and receives feedback.</li>
                <li><b>Sprint Retrospective</b> A meeting at the end of the Sprint where the Scrum Team inspects and adapts their process and identifies opportunities for improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>SCRUM artifacts</h2>
            <i>Scrum artifacts are the tangible and visible elements that provide transparency and information about the progress of a Scrum project. They include:</i>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Product Backlog: </b> A prioritized list of features or items that need to be completed for the product. It is maintained by the Product Owner.</li>
                <li><b>Sprint Backlog </b> A subset of the Product Backlog items that the Development Team plans to complete during the upcoming Sprint. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting.</li>
                <li><b>Increment: </b> The sum of all the completed Product Backlog items at the end of a Sprint. It is the working version of the product that can be potentially released to the market.</li>
            </ul>
            <i>These artifacts provide transparency and allow the team and stakeholders to understand the current state of the project and progress towards the end goal.</i>
